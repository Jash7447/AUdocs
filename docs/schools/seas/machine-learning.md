# Machine Learning

**Faculty**:

#### Batch: 2024

#### Description

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that involves the development of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This course provides an introduction to machine learning concepts, including supervised and unsupervised learning, clustering, classification, regression, and deep learning. Students will learn about various machine learning techniques and their applications in real-world scenarios such as image recognition, speech recognition, and natural language processing. In addition, the course will cover key algorithms and tools used in machine learning, such as TensorFlow and scikit-learn. By the end of the course, students should be able to develop and implement their own machine learning algorithms to solve complex problems.
