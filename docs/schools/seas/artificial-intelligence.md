#### Batch: 2024

#### Description

Artificial intelligence (AI) is a rapidly growing field that involves developing intelligent machines that can perform tasks that would typically require human intelligence. This course provides an in-depth understanding of AI concepts and techniques, including natural language processing, machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and robotics. Students will learn how to design and develop intelligent systems that can perceive their environment, reason about it, and take appropriate actions. The course will also cover ethical and societal implications of AI, such as bias and privacy concerns. By the end of the course, students should have a strong foundation in AI and be able to apply their knowledge to develop intelligent systems.
