# AUdocs

Let's discover **AUdocs in less than 5 minutes**.

## Getting Started

Head to the github and fork the repository.

### What you'll need

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) version 14 or above:
  - When installing Node.js, you are recommended to check all checkboxes related to dependencies.

## Build the site

Open your root directory and run the following commands

```
npm install

npm run start
```

You will see the site up on your local server in a giffy.

## Make your first contribution...

All changes made would be pertaining to the docs folder. You may upload courses or new projects or anything AU related with enthusiasm.

You can always open issues in case you do not want to deal with the source code.

All contributions would be truly appreciated.
