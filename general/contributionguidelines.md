# How to Contribute

* [Submitting Resources](contributionguidelines.md#submitting-resources)
* [Submitting Patches](contributionguidelines.md#submitting-patches)

Please follow this guide for all contributions. If you are new to git and github, we request you to go through the [Newbies](../General/Newbies.md) section.

You may also discuss contributions and other stuff on our [discord](contributionguidelines.md) server.

## Submitting Resources

You can submit resources using one of the following two methods.

### 1. Creating an issue

You may create an issue on this repository listing the resource you want to submit. Please mention the following for any resource you would like to submit. Please follow the following template structure when you create an issue to submit resources.

```
Issue Title: Resource Update: <Resource Type>/<Resource Name>

Resource Title:
Resource Path: Path/To/Resource // Where you think the resource can be placed in the repository.
Resource Files:
Resource Links:
```

Please check out some preset templates for specific resources. We request you to immitate the current repository structure as closely as possible in order to keep the repository structured.

### 2. Directly Updating Resources to the Repository

You may directly update the resources by forking the repository, updating the resources you want to contribute at the specific location and then opening a pull request. We request you to open only complete pull requests. Every pull request would be reviewed in order to maintain the repository structure.

## Submitting Patches

You may submit patches to the repository wherever you feel they are required. Please do not open issues and submit patches for minor gramatical errors and spacing corrections. Such updates would then be considered in the next patch submission. We also request you to discuss any major changes with the community before opening a pull request.

## Uploading New Courses

All courses are supposed to be housed in their respective locations. You can generally figure out the location based on the folder structure. Every course must only have one file consisting of all the links to the respective material.

The file for the respective course must be named as follows

`CourseCode_CourseName.md`

The same data must be updated in the respective index files of the folder which is being updated.

## General Guidelines

* We request you to check your commits for repetitive commits before updating content to the documentation.
* We follow the [contributor's covenent](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as a structure for our community.
